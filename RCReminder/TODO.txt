What has to be done:
=================================================================================================================================
Add support for "Remind me at these times"
If "Remind me every" or "Remind me at these times" are unchecked, don't display those/try to get that data
Don't update until save pressed
If reset, don't update until save pressed
If close Settings and reopen, there's a bug
Create a RCReminder.SETTINGS file to save the information into
  - 1 data entry per line at first
  - then JSON once that is working
